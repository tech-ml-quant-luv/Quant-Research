## Next Steps to Try

**Validation & Testing:**
1. Combinatorial Purged Cross-Validation (CPCV)
2. Embargo period between train/test to prevent leakage
3. Deflated Sharpe Ratio calculation
4. Probability of backtest overfitting (PBO)
5. Monte Carlo permutation tests

**Feature Engineering:**
6. Fractionally differentiated features (preserve memory, achieve stationarity)
7. Triple-barrier labeling (meta-labeling framework)
8. CUSUM filter for structural breaks
9. Information-driven bars (volume, dollar, tick bars instead of time)
10. Microstructural features (Kyle's lambda, VPIN, Roll measure)

**Sampling & Weighting:**
11. Sample weights based on uniqueness (de-correlate overlapping labels)
12. Sequential bootstrapping (preserve time-series properties)
13. Time-decay weighting for recent observations

**Model Improvements:**
14. Meta-labeling (predict size given side, not direction)
15. Multi-class with magnitude (your 5-class idea)
16. Ensemble of models from different time regimes
17. Bet sizing based on prediction confidence

**Risk & Position Management:**
18. Asymmetric risk-reward entries (1:3 ratio)
19. Dynamic position sizing (Kelly Criterion, bet sizing algorithm)
20. Concurrency limits (max correlated positions)

**Feature Importance & Selection:**
21. Mean Decrease Impurity (MDI) with correct implementation
22. Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA)
23. Single Feature Importance (SFI)
24. Clustered Feature Importance
25. PCA on feature space

**Target/Label Engineering:**
26. Fixed-time horizon vs. triple barrier
27. Trend-scanning labels
28. Volatility-adjusted returns as target
